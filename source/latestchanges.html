<ul>
<li>FEATURE: Private no-args constructor for <code>@Data</code> and <code>@Value</code> to enable deserialization frameworks (like Jackson) to operate out-of-the-box. Use <code>lombok.noArgsConstructor.extraPrivate = false</code> to disable this behavior.</li>
<li>FEATURE: Methods can now be marked for inclusion in <code>toString</code>, <code>equals</code>, and <code>hashCode</code> generation. There is a new mechanism to mark which fields (and now, methods) are to be included or excluded for the generation of these methods: mark the relevant member with for example <code>@ToString.Include</code> or <code>@EqualsAndHashCode.Exclude</code>. ToString documentation EqualsAndHashCode documentation</li>
<li>FEATURE: <code>@Getter</code> and <code>@Setter</code> also allow <code>onMethod</code> and <code>onParam</code> when put on a type. <br /></li>
<li>FEATURE: <code>@FieldNameConstants</code> is a new feature that generates string constants for your field names. Docs on @FieldNameConstants.</li>
<li>PLATFORM: Lombok can be compiled on JDK10, and should run on JDK10.</li>
<li>PLATFORM: lombok now counts as an <em>incremental annotation processor</em> for gradle. Should speed up your gradle builds considerably!</li>
<li>PLATFORM: Fix for using lombok together with JDK9+'s new <code>module-info.java</code> feature.</li>
<li>BUGFIX: Solved some issues in eclipse that resulted in error 'A save participant caused problems'.</li>
<li>BUGFIX: Netbeans on jdk9.</li>
<li>BUGFIX: Netbeans &lt; 9.</li>
<li>PROMOTION: <code>var</code> has been promoted from experimental to the main package with no changes. The 'old' experimental one is still around but is deprecated, and is an alias for the new main package one. var documentation.</li>
<li>OLD-CRUFT: <code>lombok.experimental.Builder</code> and <code>lombok.experimental.Value</code> are deprecated remnants of when these features were still in experimental. They are now removed entirely. If your project is dependent on an older version of lombok which still has those; fret not, lombok still processes these annotations. It just no longer includes them in the jar.</li>
